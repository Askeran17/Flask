<p>
    The legacy of the Byzantine Empire endures far beyond its fall in 1453. As the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire, Byzantium preserved classical knowledge, Christian theology, and imperial governance for over a millennium. Its cultural, religious, and political influence shaped Eastern Europe, the Orthodox Church, and even the Renaissance in Western Europe.

<p>
    Byzantine art and architecture, exemplified by the majestic Hagia Sophia, inspired generations of builders and artists. The empire’s legal reforms, especially the Corpus Juris Civilis compiled under Justinian I, became the foundation of modern civil law in many European nations.
</p>

<p>
    The Orthodox Christian tradition, deeply rooted in Byzantine theology and liturgy, remains vibrant today in countries such as Greece, Russia, Serbia, and Georgia. The empire’s diplomatic strategies, military innovations, and administrative systems were studied and emulated by neighboring powers for centuries.
</p>

<p>
    Even in its final moments, Byzantium stood as a symbol of resilience. The heroic defense of Constantinople by Constantine XI Palaiologos became a legend of sacrifice and loyalty. The fall of the empire marked the end of an era, but its spirit lives on in the institutions, beliefs, and cultural memory of countless peoples.
</p>

<p>
    To understand Byzantium is to understand the bridge between antiquity and the modern world — a civilization that refused to vanish quietly and instead left behind a legacy that continues to shape our present.
